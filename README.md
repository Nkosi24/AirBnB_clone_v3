hbnb is a full-stack clone of the web application AirBnB. This clone was built in four iterative phases. This version includes completion of Phase 1 from AirBnB_clone_v1: Console and web static, Phase 2 from AirBnB_clone_v2 plus Phase 3, which involves exposing stored objects via a JSON web interface and manipulating objects via a custom RESTful API.
